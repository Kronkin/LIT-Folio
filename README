This is my first time using GitHub and I am still finding my feet.

LIT Folio is a team project by myself and two classmates at LIT Clonmel.

It is a portfolio website that students can host their work on. This would include, images, audio and video.

Primarily we are constructing a working prototype that will be able to function as a live site that can fulfil our
project proposal.

We are limited by certain elements such as hosting. This limits our ability to stream video and host large files.
To accomodate the hosting of video we are using Vimeo's API to connect the users account to our site and we just 
embed the video and thumbnails into our site.
